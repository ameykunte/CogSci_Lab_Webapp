                The group works on a range of research topics, from
                understanding cognitive processes to perception-based
                engineering. The human understanding is derived and finds
                applications in domains such as serious games, empathy,
                neuroeconomics, (non)clinical assistive systems, urban planning
                interfaces, human intelligence, visual system &amp; color and
                design of sensors. Spanning fundamental research to applied, the
                endeavor is to develop perceptive cognitive systems for positive
                social impact.

                Besides the research areas mentioned above, the group also works
                on plasticity during stroke recovery, which is analyzed using
                EEG technique and controlled motor actions. Here, we are also
                testing the effectiveness of using serious games for
                accelerating recover. While prior studies included measuring the
                concept of ‘quiet-eye’ and strategy as applied in badminton and
                carrom. Eye tracking was used to study scan/gaze differences of
                professional players and amateurs.
